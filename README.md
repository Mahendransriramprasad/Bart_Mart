# Bart_Mart
The Bart Mart Repository contains the codebase and resources for building and maintaining the Bart Mart platform. This project focuses on creating a web-based barter system, where users can trade goods using points instead of currency.
Key Features:
User Authentication: Allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
Product Listings: Users can list products for sale, view available products, and search by categories.
Point System: Users earn points by selling products and spend points to buy items listed by others.
Bargaining Chat: A messaging feature for users to negotiate prices and terms.
Responsive Design: The platform is built to be mobile-friendly and easy to navigate across devices.
Admin Panel: For managing users, products, and overseeing transactions.
The repository includes the source code for the front-end (HTML, CSS, React) and back-end (Node.js, Express), along with any additional libraries or tools necessary for the projectâ€™s functionality.
